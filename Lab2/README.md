# Lab 2

## Instructions
1. Write a function to check whether a contract has code or not. Hint: Use assembly function. 
2. Implement a smart contract that interacts with another contract via delegate calls to update state variables. Note: Do not use the same example from class. 
3. Explain advantages and disadvantages of using atomic swaps and cross-chain bridges. 

#### Check for code

#### Contract delegate calls

#### Advantages of Atomic Swaps:
   - Peer-to-peer trading
   - Lower costs
   - Security
   - Decentralized nature
   - Altcoin exchange

#### Disadvantages of Atomic Swaps:
   - Complexity and conditions
   - Privacy issues

#### Advantages of Cross-Chain Bridges:
   - Interoperability
   - Flexibility

#### Disadvantages of Cross-Chain Bridges:
   - Centralization
   - Security
   - Complexity
